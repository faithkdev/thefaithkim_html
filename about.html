                    Hi! My name is Faith, and I am a full stack software engineer 
                    with a background in backend. I graduated from Smith College in May 2019 
                    with a B.A. in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I first started out using Java and Spring in my professional career, 
                    and now I'm using Django (Python) and ReactJS with Typescript in my day-to-day. 
                    I'm also interested in game development and have made games for school projects in the past.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My true passion lies in mentorship for womxn of color in the tech industry. 
                    I have worked as the Vice President of Smith College's Computer Science organization, 
                    Smithies in CS, in hopes of creating a comfortable and inclusive space for students of 
                    all background to learn about tech and computer science. I hope to garner my skills 
                    and experience in the tech industry to offer more helpful resources to womxn in tech.
                </p>
