                    <p>I currently work as a fullstack engineer at CaptivateIQ. I work
                        on creating new features to help customers calculate sales commissions, working on
                        improving the existing UI and creating new UI features, building new API's, and optimizing the
                        performance
                        of our application. Our tech stack is Django, React, and PostgreSQL.

                        Previously, I worked as a backend software engineer for CME Group. I worked in the
                        Trade Execution division supporting applications that calculate settlement prices for a variety
                        of
                        products/contracts, where
                        we mainly use Java and Spring for our backend framework, Oracle for database.

                        I worked closely

                        our business team to develop new settlement algorithms, support app maintenance in production,
                        and
                        deploy
                        builds with new features to enhance user experience and settlement processes.

                    <h2>A Piece of Java: Intro to Programming</h2>
                    <p><i>A Piece of Java</i> is an introductory book that teaches readers how to code in Java.
                        It is intended to be a friendly guide to readers who are just starting out in programming. I
                        wanted
                        to take my passion for coding and teaching to the next level by writing this book. It is
                        currently available on Amazon
                        and kindllle. It was an incredibly fun process writing the book and designing the book cover!

                    <p>Smith College provides a space to explore video games on campus, varying from consoles like PS4,
                        PC, Nintendo Switch, and so on.
                        The struggle lied in how to keep track of allt he games the Lab had in its inventory. To solve
                        this problem a search engine
                        for the Gaming Lab had been created through this web application.

                        <i>Everything's fine</i> was a semester long student project dedicated to opening up a dialogue
                        about mental health on
                        Smith College's campus. The protagonist, Chi, is a student of color who struggles with
                        atychiphobia, the fear of failure. We explore
                        Chi's anxiety in a familiar 2D sidescroll gameplay, but we worked to subvert the idea of
                        "winning" and "speedrunning" through
                        the entire game for rewards, as one would see in traditional Mario and Sonic games.

                        <i>Deathless</i> is an ongoing game project developed and directed by Sienna Cornish. Through
                        her
                        mentorship, I was given the opportunity to learn how to work with an existing codebase and
                        develop features for backend and front-facing components of the game. I have developed
                        scripts that triggered sound on an event-driven basis, along with developing scripts to
                        support Wwise audio. I have also added enhancements to the Unity editor to allow for
                        flexible manipulation of different attributes in a component. I have also developed
                        animation scripts for items when they are added into the player's inventory.
