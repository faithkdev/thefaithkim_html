                    <p>I currently work as a fullstack engineer at CaptivateIQ. I work
                        on creating new features to help customers calculate sales commissions, working on
                        improving the existing UI and creating new UI features, building new API's, and optimizing the
                        performance
                        of our application. Our tech stack is Django, React, and PostgreSQL.

                        Previously, I worked as a backend software engineer for CME Group. I worked in the
                        Trade Execution division supporting applications that calculate settlement prices for a variety
                        of
                        products/contracts, where
                        we mainly use Java and Spring for our backend framework, Oracle for database.

                    <p>
                        I worked closely
                        with
                        our business team to develop new settlement algorithms, support app maintenance in production,
                        and
                        deploy
                        builds with new features to enhance user experience and settlement processes.

                    <h2>A Piece of Java: Intro to Programming</h2>
                    <p><i>A Piece of Java</i> is an introductory book that teaches readers how to code in Java.
                        It is intended to be a friendly guide to readers who are just starting out in programming. I
                        wanted
                        to take my passion for coding and teaching to the next level by writing this book. It is
                        currently available on Amazon
                        and kindllle. It was an incredibly fun process writing the book and designing the book cover!
